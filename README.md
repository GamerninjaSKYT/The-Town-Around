# The-Town-Around (Placeholder name)
 The Town Around is a text adventure game that aims to be inspired by Dwarf Fortress and potentially as complex.\
 If this game will achieve that goal is uncertain but hey trying is fun!\
 PRs are appreciated

 ## How to run
 First, if you happen to not have it, install python3 and pip.\
 Then install PyInstaller by running "pip install pyinstaller" in your terminal.\
 Then download the files of this repository, open a terminal inside the downloaded folder and run "pyinstaller game.py --onefile".\
 And right after that just run "./dist/game".\
